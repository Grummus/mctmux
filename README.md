# Graham's Crappy Minecraft Server Launcher
Grummus's Crappy Server Launcher

A little something I made so I can SSH into my Minecraft Server  
Uses GNU Screen  

# Features:  
-Streamlines the Spigot update process  
-Makes it easy to change allocated memory  
-Allows you to SSH into your server console without stopping it  

# To use:  
-Change the 'serverdir' variable in minecraftserver.sh to where you want your minecraft server to be  
-Run 'chmod +x install.sh'  
-Run ./install.sh  
-Enter the serverdir you used before, the server type, and the Minecraft version

When you SSH onto your server just run 'minecraftserver' and it'll do the rest ;)
