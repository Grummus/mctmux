# MCTMUX
[![release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v0.2--beta-brightgreen.svg)](http://github.com/Grummus/mctmux/releases)  

A little something I made so I can SSH into my Minecraft Server using TMUX 

# Features:  
-Streamlines the Spigot update process  
-Makes it easy to change allocated memory  
-Allows you to SSH into your server console without stopping it  
-Shows online players and any custom ascii art in top right corner  

# To use:   
-Run 'chmod +x install.sh'  
-Run ./install.sh  

When you SSH onto your server just run 'minecraftserver' and it'll do the rest ;)
