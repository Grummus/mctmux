# Graham's Crappy Minecraft Server Launcher
Grummus's Crappy Server Launcher

A little something I made so I can SSH into my Minecraft Server  
Uses GNU Screen  

To use  
-Place update.sh and start.sh in your serverdir  
-To use the update script, place spigot's buildtools folder into your serverdir  
-Change the serverdir to wherever your Minecraft Server is stored  

When you SSH onto your server just run ./minecraftserver.sh and it'll do the rest ;)
